The Age Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their age based on their birthdate.

## Features

- Calculates the age in years and days.
- Displays the day of the week for the birthdate.
- Provides an error message for invalid or future dates.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Select your birthdate using the date picker.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The calculated age, day of the week, and age in days will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

The Age Calculator uses JavaScript to perform the calculations and update the HTML elements dynamically. Here's a breakdown of the code logic:

1. The `calculateAge()` function is triggered when the user clicks the "Calculate" button.
2. It retrieves the selected birthdate from the input field.
3. It checks if the selected date is valid and not a future date. If it's invalid or a future date, an error message is displayed, and the function returns.
4. If the date is valid, the function calculates the age in years and days.
5. It retrieves the day of the week for the birthdate.
6. The HTML elements for displaying the labels and values are created dynamically using JavaScript.
7. The calculated values and labels are added to their respective elements.
8. The previous content in the result container is cleared.
9. The newly created elements are appended to the result container, displaying the calculated age.
